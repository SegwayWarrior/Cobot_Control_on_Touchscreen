# Final_Project

## Problem Statement:
For my final project, my goal was to design a drive system for a haptic device called the Touchbot, which is currently being developed by Professor Colgate and his
team at Northwestern University.  Without getting into the details of his system, the Touchbot is designed to allow a user to get haptic feedback on a single finger
while they are interacting with a touchscreen.  The drive system would act as a cariage for the Touchbot, as well as a cobot like device, letting the user push
the device in one direction, while the cobot only changes the direction the wheel(s) are facing, aka the direction the user can move in.

## Development Process
The Touchbot drive system had some unique specifications to consider during development.  First of all, Professor Colgate wanted the touchbot as low as possible to 
the screen as possible, which led to the O-ring wheel's being embedded into the gears that support them, allowing the touchbot to be as close to the touchscreen as
possible, with only it's supporting plate underneath it.  Another specification was to allow the possiblity of using multiple touchbots, ideally one for each of the
user's fingers.
